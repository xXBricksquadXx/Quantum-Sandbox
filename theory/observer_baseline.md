## The Calibration

The human mind is not an impartial observer; it is a measuring instrument. The NeuroSubsystem proved that "Purity" (Tr(ρ2)) is the signal-to-noise ratio of consciousness.

## The Spacetime Reference

By aligning with the vacuum baseline (∣0⟩), the observer minimizes decoherence. Project Chronos now assumes a Calibrated Observer capable of measuring relativistic state changes without "Market Time" bias.
