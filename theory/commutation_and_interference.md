# Commutation and Interference: The Cost of Observation

## 📡 Signal Scrambling (Non-Commutation)

some operations are "Commutative"—the order doesn't matter. In Quantum, order is everything. If two **Operators** (A and B) do not commute, it means:
$$[A, B] = AB - BA \neq 0$$

**Analogy**:

- Measuring Frequency ($A$) then Phase ($B$) gives a different result than $B$ then $A$.
- The act of measuring $A$ "scrambles" the state of $B$. This is the mathematical root of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**.

## 🌊 Constructive vs. Destructive Interference

Because we are working with complex wavefunctions, the "Signal" can reinforce itself (Constructive) or cancel itself out (Destructive).

- **Mirror Tech Hypothesis**: Manifestation may be the act of creating "Constructive Interference" between a thought-state and a matter-state.
