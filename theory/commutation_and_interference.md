# Commutation & Interference: Signal Management

## 🚦 Non-Commutation: The Heisenberg Gate

If two operators don't commute ($[A,B] \neq 0$), you can't have "SIPR-level" clarity on both at once. Measuring one scrambles the other.

- **Observation Cost**: The act of "Tuning" to one frequency necessarily detunes the other.

## 🌊 Hydrogen Anti-Drift

By utilizing **Destructive Interference**, we can "dampen" the drift of an electron's resonance.

- **Resonance**: We target the $L=1,2$ states (Hydrogen) as our "Gearbox."
- **Anti-Drift**: Introducing a secondary wave function to lock the state against environmental noise.
