# Non-Linear Observables: Beyond the Physical

## 📏 Linear Standpoint

Current Quantum Mechanics focuses on linear observables: Position, Momentum, Spin. These are "physical properties" we can easily chart.

## 🔄 The Hypothesis

Consciousness may be a **Non-Linear Observable**. We are currently trying to measure the "volume" of a thought, but we should be measuring its **Phase Coherence** or **Information Density**.

## 🚀 Sandbox Potential

If we identify the "Mathematics of Meaning," we can build "Operators" (Lecture 4) that allow a virtual environment to react to intentionality as a primary data input.
