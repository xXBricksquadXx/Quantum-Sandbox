# Measurement Artifacts vs. Intentionality

## 🛠️ The Problem of Decoherence

Critics argue that "mind-matter" interactions are simply **artifacts**—noise produced by analysis flaws or thermal interference in the sensors.

## 🛰️ S6 Context: Atmospheric Ducting

Just as weather can create a "false target" on radar (ducting), environmental noise can create a "false signal" in quantum data.

## 🛡️ Our Methodology

We utilize **Bayesian Inference** (`speculative_math/bayesian_psi.py`) to calculate the probability that a signal is:

1. **Noise**: A measurement artifact.
2. **Intentionality**: A statistically significant deviation caused by an observer.
