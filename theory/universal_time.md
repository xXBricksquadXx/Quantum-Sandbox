# Project Chronos: Theory of Universal Time

## 1. The Problem: "Market Time" (The Box)

Current human timekeeping (Gregorian Calendar) is an **Application Layer** protocol designed for agriculture and commerce.

- **The Glitch:** It requires constant patching (Leap Years) because it tries to force a digital grid onto an analog solar cycle.

- **The Illusion:** It assumes a "Universal Now" (Simultaneity), ignoring the laws of relativity.

- **The Result:** We operate inside a "Box" (Earth's Hypersurface of the Present) and ignore the reality outside it.

## 2. The Solution: "Universal Time" (The Physics)

We define time not by the rotation of a rock (Earth), but by the fundamental constants of the vacuum.

### A. The Base Units

- **Planck Time ($t_P$):** The smallest measurable unit of time ($5.39 \times 10^{-44} s$). This is the "Tick Rate" of the universe.

- **Entropy ($S$):** Time is directional. $t$ only moves forward because Entropy ($S$) increases.

### B. The Variables (Distortion)

Time is not a constant; it is a variable function of **Mass** and **Velocity**.

1.  **Mass is Presence ($E=mc^2$):** High energy/mass creates a gravity well.
    - _Deep Well (Ocean Floor):_ Time moves slower.

    - _High Vacuum (Space):_ Time moves faster.

2.  **The Light Cone (Latency):**
    - We do not see the "Present." We see the past.

    - **Betelgeuse Effect:** An event 640 light-years away happened 640 years ago. We are processing "Cached Data."

### C. The Bypass (Wormholes)

- **Broadcasting:** Sending a signal through normal space (The Cone) results in signal degradation (Inverse Square Law) and latency.

- **Tunneling:** An **Einstein-Rosen Bridge** acts as a "Fiber Optic" cable through spacetime, connecting two "Hypersurfaces" directly, bypassing latency.

## 3. As Above, So Below

- **The Macro:** Solar Flares (CMEs) physically alter Earth's electromagnetic resonance (Schumann Resonance).

- **The Micro:** Human biological rhythms are entrained to this resonance. We are "overclocked" by the star we orbit.
