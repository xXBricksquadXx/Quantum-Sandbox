# The Pauli-Jung Framework: Dual-Aspect Monism

## 🌌 Overview

Inspired by the collaboration between physicist Wolfgang Pauli and psychologist Carl Jung, this framework suggests that **Mind** and **Matter** are not separate entities but two "frequencies" of a single underlying reality (the _Unus Mundus_).

## 📡 Signal Intel Analogy: Dual-Frequency Sync

In radio ops, a receiver might need to be synced across two different frequencies to demodulate a single coherent message.

- **Matter**: The "Exoteric" frequency (Physical artifacts, position, mass).
- **Mind**: The "Esoteric" frequency (Meaning, intentionality, subjective experience).

## 🔬 Scientific Context

Science currently lacks a 'Meaning Meter.' We observe **Synchronicity** as a non-causal correlation—like two qubits being entangled without a physical wire connecting them.

## 📝 Dr. Angela Puca Insights

- Respecting the "Lived Experience" of the practitioner.
- Bridging the gap between intellectual precision and subjective reality.
