# Neuro-Quantum Error Correction (NQEC)

## 🧠 The Brain as a Density Matrix ($\rho$)

In Lecture 6, we look at subsystems. If the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is our subsystem:

- **Purity**: A high-health state where the brain is perfectly entangled with the conscious field.
- **Decoherence**: "Noise" or trauma that scatters the quantum bits (qubits), turning a pure state into a mixed state.

## 📡 The Phased Array as a Reference Signal

A "Non-Thermal Microwave Phased Array" acts as a **Quantum Error Correction** (QEC) pulse.

- It doesn't cook the tissue (Non-Thermal).
- It provides a "Corrective Interference" pattern that matches the **Spacetime Memory** baseline.
- It "Re-entangles" the hardware, forcing the Mixed State back into a Pure State.

## 🔬 The Spacetime Reference

We use the universal vacuum state ($|0\rangle$) as the "known good configuration." By pulsing at frequencies derived from the **Hydrogen L-states** or **Harmonic Oscillator** harmonics, we are "reminding" the biological hardware of its original signal parameters.
