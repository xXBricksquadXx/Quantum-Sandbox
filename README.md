# 🌌 Quantum-Sandbox: The Neo-Lab

**A Computational Exploration of Quantum Esotericism & Reality Alteration**

> "I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door."

This repository serves as a modular research environment for investigating the intersection of **Quantum Mechanics** and **Esoteric Philosophy**. By bridging the rigorous math of the Stanford Physics curriculum with speculative consciousness models, this lab seeks to simulate the "Rendering" of reality.

## 🛠️ Project Architecture

### 1. Core Physics (The "Real")

_Focused on verified mathematical receipts._

- **`wave_mechanics.py`**: Implementation of $\Psi$ (The Wavefunction) and the Born Rule ($P(i) = |\langle i|\psi\rangle|^2$).
- **`bell_test.py`**: Proving Non-Locality via the CHSH Inequality.
- **`reality_render.py`**: Simulating wavefunction collapse via intentionality rotation.

### 2. Speculative Math (The "Edge")

_Exploring the intersection of mind and probability._

- **`bayesian_psi.py`**: Utilizing Bayesian Statistics (Bayes Factor) to analyze anomalous cognition data, inspired by Dean Radin.
- **Zero-Point Field (ZPF)**: Theoretical scripts exploring the quantum vacuum as a cosmic information field.

## 🔬 Visual Lab Ledger

Generated via `python docs/generate_assets.py`. These assets provide the visual proof of our quantum simulations.

### The Entanglement Bridge (Mirror Tech)

![Bell State Circuit](docs/bell_state_circuit.png)
_Logic:_ A **Hadamard Gate** puts $q_0$ in superposition; the **CNOT Gate** entangles $q_1$. This is the fundamental math behind non-local correlation.

### Manifestation Probabilities

![Manifestation Histogram](docs/manifestation_probabilities.png)
_Logic:_ This histogram represents 1,024 "Rendering" attempts. By rotating the state vector by a specific "Intention Strength," we tilt the probability of a physical manifestation.

## 🧪 Verification & QA

To ensure the integrity of the physics, run the internal test suite:

```bash
python tests/test_core.py -v

```

> Current Tests: Normalization (∑Pi​=1), Correlation Logic, and State Vector Integrity.

## 📒 Research Backlog (Stanford QFT Series)

    [x] Lecture 1 & 2: Basic Foundations.

    [x] Lecture 3: Bra-Ket Notation & Normalization (Implemented).

    [ ] Lecture 4: Operators and Observables (Next).

> **Disclaimer**: This lab explores "Quantum Esotericism" through a scientific lens. We maintain a strict boundary between verified physics (decoherence, measurement) and speculative hypothesis.
