# 🌌 Quantum-Sandbox: The Neo-Lab

**A Computational Exploration of Quantum Esotericism & Reality Alteration**

> "I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door."

This repository serves as a modular research environment for investigating the intersection of **Quantum Mechanics** and **Esoteric Philosophy**. By bridging the rigorous math of the Stanford Physics curriculum with speculative consciousness models, this lab seeks to simulate the "Rendering" of reality.

## 🛠️ Project Architecture

### 1. Core Physics (The "Real")

_Focused on verified mathematical receipts._

- **`wave_mechanics.py`**: Implementation of $\Psi$ (The Wavefunction) and the Born Rule ($P(i) = |\langle i|\psi\rangle|^2$).
- **`bell_test.py`**: Proving Non-Locality via the CHSH Inequality.
- **`reality_render.py`**: Simulating wavefunction collapse via intentionality rotation.

### 2. Speculative Math (The "Edge")

_Exploring the intersection of mind and probability._

- **`bayesian_psi.py`**: Utilizing Bayesian Statistics (Bayes Factor) to analyze anomalous cognition data, inspired by Dean Radin.
- **Zero-Point Field (ZPF)**: Theoretical scripts exploring the quantum vacuum as a cosmic information field.

## 🔬 Visual Lab Ledger

Generated via `python docs/generate_assets.py`. These assets provide the visual proof of our quantum simulations.

### The Entanglement Bridge (Mirror Tech)

![Bell State Circuit](docs/bell_state_circuit.png)

_Logic:_ A **Hadamard Gate** puts $q_0$ in superposition; the **CNOT Gate** entangles $q_1$. This is the fundamental math behind non-local correlation.

### Manifestation Probabilities

![Manifestation Histogram](docs/manifestation_probabilities.png)

_Logic:_ This histogram represents 1,024 "Rendering" attempts. By rotating the state vector by a specific "Intention Strength," we tilt the probability of a physical manifestation.

### The Universal Index (Energy Offsets)

![Energy Index Chart](docs/energy_indices.png)

_Logic:_ This chart visualizes the "Global State Array." It maps the **Dirac Sea (-1)** as the vacuum baseline, the **Ground State (0)**, and the **Hydrogen Resonances (L=1, 2)**. By treating energy levels as array indices, we remove the "magic" and treat reality as a queryable data structure.

### The Kinetic-Mass Bridge (Vibration vs. Mass)

![Vibration-Mass Slope](docs/vibration_mass_slope.png)

_Logic:_ This plot demonstrates the relativistic "Weight" gain of a system. As we use the **Ladder Operators** to increase the vibrational level ($n$), the internal energy ($E$) rises. Per $E=mc^2$, this increases the **Invariant Mass**, proving that a "Hot" or "Resonating" system has more physical presence in the field than a "Cold" one.

## 🧪 Verification & QA

To ensure the integrity of the physics, run the internal test suite:

```bash
# Check the math
python tests/test_core.py
python tests/test_oscillator.py

# Regenerate the visual receipts
python docs/generate_assets.py

```

## 📍 Finalized Baseline: Lecture 5 (Relativity & Vibration)

We have successfully bridged the gap between **Quantum Oscillation** and **Einsteinian Relativity**. By implementing the "Box of Molecules" logic, we demonstrate that "Weight" is a dynamic property of internal energy density.

### 🛠️ Core Modules

- **`harmonic_oscillator.py`**: The vibration engine. Contains `LadderOperator` (state shifters) and `HarmonicOscillator` (mass-energy calculation).
- **`theory/kinetic_mass_and_relativity.md`**: Documentation on why a "Hot" system is physically heavier than a "Cold" one.

### 📡 The Resonance Theory

This baseline provides the mathematical framework for investigating "High-Signal" structures (Obelisks, Resonators). If mass is energy, then resonance is a mechanism for increasing a system's physical presence in the field.
